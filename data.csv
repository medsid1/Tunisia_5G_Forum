Wearables,"It is now commonplace for most people to own mobile connected leisure wearables such as fitness trackers that actively capture, process and report real-time data that can then be accessed and assessed by the user. However, with the introduction of 5G, similar trackers will be able to make advantage of much faster connection speeds and ultimately transform the standard doctor/patient relationship around the world.Clinical tracking devices and low-energy, low bit-rate sensors will allow doctors to remotely monitor and analyse patient�s vitals, activity and even potentially tell them whether the user has taken medication without the need to travel to a surgery or hospital location, freeing up vital time and resources to be used elsewhere. These devices are known as IoMT (Internet of Medical Things).The data captured by IoMT devices will support fully-predicative analytics, greatly reducing the time it will take to detect a health issue and significantly increasing the accuracy of doctor�s diagnoses.",healthcare,
Secure remote consultations,"With 5G services, trips to your local doctor�s surgery could become a thing of the past. With the greatly improved data rates that 5G will bring, 3D ultra-HD live video streaming will allow you to connect with your GP in real-time and even access VR (virtual-reality) services simultaneously to help doctors to explain care and patients understand treatment.These services are invaluable for those patients who are less able to access physical locations because of health issues or the rural location of their home.Aside from patient care, the same remote streaming consultations could be used for professional training to other healthcare professionals around the world who would otherwise be confined to text-books or basic online learning resources. Using VR, medical students would be able to virtually follow a real-life example of patient care.",healthcare,
Assisted and fully robotic surgery,"It may sound like something out of a science-fiction movie, but automated, assisted and fully-robotic services has already begun in surgeries around the world and will significantly improve with the introduction of 5G. This includes the use of haptic devices such as gloves, that allow a surgeon to wear a glove-like device to remotely move and �feel� the patient they are operating on from a different location.The use of such robotic devices could be used for extremely long surgeries where a human surgeon could become fatigued or lose concentration over a long period of time. Also, they could be used as an assistant to a human surgeon, guiding and assessing the patient as the surgeon operates.",healthcare,
2D/3D scanning,"Potentially one of the oldest and most important techniques for diagnoses comes from scanning a patient�s body for clues and information in to their condition. With 5G, scanning could be achieved at a fraction of the time it currently takes and made available for review more quickly and to more healthcare professionals in near real-time. The services could also feed in to the video and VR capabilities that 5G would bring, allowing for multiple patient assessment and ultimately more accurate diagnosis.It would also be able to assist in training, again for trainee professionals to better understand a patient and their symptoms.",healthcare,
Video Analytics,"Smart farming all about collecting the right data and using it to optimize your resource-planning and operation. Artificial Vision technologies using artificial intelligence are making waves in the agriculture sector just like they are in any other. Smart Agriculture is a major use case for vision-based automation and data analytics applications, driven by drones and vision based harvesting, weeding and so on. Deploying compute capabilities using ventless industrial PC�s at the edge allows for on-site analytics and quick access to graphic-heavy data and analytics.Besides edge computing devices, deployment of 4G/LTE/5G connectivity is another key factor in evolution of high-resolution visual data collection in remote environment. Industrial Communication Gateways with integrated LTE connectivity offer a great onsite compute platform along with cellular communication with cloud.",agriculture,
Environmental Monitoring,"One of the biggest advantages that edge computing has brought to farming and agriculture over the past few years is the ability to remotely monitor different aspects of a farm�s agricultural operations. Networks of sensors, ranging from several sporadically placed sensors to thousands of connected devices monitoring aspects such as soil, weather and humidity and temperature conditions as well as acidity and pH levels.Edge computing allows for the data necessary in delivering such solutions to be generated and collected much closer to the source while also enabling some data processing operations to be performed in the edge devices themselves. Allowing farmers and agricultural workers detailed insights about their operational environments is a big selling point with any new technology, and edge computing is no different.",agriculture,
 Robotics,"While neither robotics technologies or artificial intelligence systems have quite given us the android companions science fiction has predicted for so long, we are now getting to a point in time where such robotic iterations don�t seem so much like science fiction anymore and appear to us more as feasible possibilities.While robotics has been an active part of many industries for decades now, car manufacturing, for example, it has also been slow to gain traction elsewhere. With the help of edge computing and IoT device networks, this is no longer the case.Within agriculture, the recent emergence of smart farming frameworks has promoted the use of edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) systems devices, and laid the groundwork to enable IoT-driven robotics to be developed for smart farms. These systems are capable of being programmed to perform automated tasks such as picking vegetables as well as spraying plants and crops, with more applications currently being developed.",agriculture,
Automation,"The use of virtualization, automation, and Big Data have been the key drivers for what has become known as the fourth industrial revolution, and so it is no surprise that automation is playing a growing role in many smart farming and agricultural enterprises. As previously mentioned, automated robotics, as well as soil injections, heaters, and lighting can all be utilised through the use of edge computing and automation systems.When coupled with the various remote monitoring applications and software now available to smart farms and agricultural enterprises, automation can become a powerful tool to farmers. The many benefits of automation continue to grow as do its applications within smart farming and, with systems such as 5G wireless networks and powerful machine learning algorithms also currently being developed, it seems automation�s role in smart farming and agriculture is just beginning.",agriculture,
Vertical Farming,"We as a species live on a planet of finite resources, and one of those finite resources is farmable land. Soil degradation is a growing problem around the world and the amount of farmable land we have is, unfortunately, slowly decreasing. In response to this growing crisis, scientists and farmers from around the world have developed what has become known as vertical farming. Vertical farming involves using the data collected from a network of IoT sensors and devices to optimize the growing of food and plants without the need for farm land.In vertical farms for example, moisture levels are controlled with a network of sensors that constantly monitor a mist that surrounds the plant. Using edge computing, much of the data processing involved in such operations can be done on the edge devices themselves, without the need to be sent to the cloud, further adding to the benefits of such systems within farming environments.While we continue to move into the Fourth Industrial Revolution, analytics technologies, automation, 5G, and AI and machine learning technologies will all begin to become more prominent and integrated into smart farms and agriculture. As we�ve seen over the course of this article, this will be in large part thanks to the foundations laid by edge computing.",agriculture,

Monitoring of Climate Conditions ,"Probably the most popular smart agriculture gadgets are weather stations, combining various smart farming sensors. Located across the field, they collect various data from the environment and send it to the cloud. The provided measurements can be used to map the climate conditions, choose the appropriate crops, and take the required measures to improve their capacity (i.e. precision farming). Some examples of such agriculture IoT devices are allMETEO, Smart Elements, and Pycno.",education, 
Greenhouse Automation,"In addition to sourcing environmental data, weather stations can automatically adjust the conditions to match the given parameters. Specifically, greenhouse automation systems use a similar principle.  For instance, Farmapp and Growlink are also IoT agriculture products offering such capabilities among others.  GreenIQ is also an interesting product that uses smart agriculture sensors. It is a smart sprinklers controller that allows you to manage your irrigation and lighting systems remotely.",education,
Crop Management,"One more type of IoT product in agriculture and another element of precision farming is crop management devices. Just like weather stations, they should be placed in the field to collect data specific to crop farming; from temperature and precipitation to leaf water potential and overall crop health, these can all be used to readily collect data and information for improved farming practices.  Thus, you can monitor your crop growth and any anomalies to effectively prevent diseases or infestations that could harm your yield. Arable and Semios can serve as good representations of how this use case can be applied in real life.",education,
Tactile  Internet  &  Skillset  c ommunication ,"Having   a  network   capable   of  transferring   our   tactile  communication  through  Internet  will  help  us  to  move  from  today �s content  and information  delivery  Internet  to  a  manual  skill set delivery  Internet .  This  will  create  new  ways  of  Tele - teaching and  T ele - mentoring especially for manual  training and skill development . The use of Tactile Internet in education  can bring new definition and experience for distance learning and distance team - working.

Focus on: predictive preloading,"The technology that will make all this possible comes in the form of the 5G predictive preloading being developed at King's College London. This innovation frees gamers from a single location, enabling them to load their devices at the touch of a button and remain uninterrupted on the move.  Handovers are a key element of cellular networks, responsible for keeping data sessions connected when a user moves from one site to another. Currently, handovers aren't as reliable as they could be, often resulting in frustrating speeds, loss of data and disconnection.  But with the emergence of 5G networks powerful enough to provide effortless handovers of data between cells, these issues will soon become problems of the past.  5G-enabled preloading technology is able to predict where a mobile user is likely to go, anticipate which cell they will move into, and then pre-emptively prepare the transfer of data. As technology moves to the cloud and time spent on mobile devices increases exponentially, the speed and efficiency generated by 5G predictive preloading will soon become absolutely crucial � and ubiquitous. Here, Peter Marshall, Principal 5G Lead with King's College London at Ericsson, discusses the game-changing research project.",education,

Remote medicine,"Remote Medicine Service was designed to serve clients charged with the welfare of  those  working  in  extreme  environments  with  limited  healthcare  but  also for people  far from specialists to investigate specific diseases. Rural and remote medicine describes  general practice at its full scope. It refers to the  professional  values,  skills  and  competencies  necessary  for  providing  high  quality,  safe and appropriate care to a rural or remote community. In  situations  where  patients  do  not  have  easy  access  to  a  ful l  suite  of  specialist  services   and   resources   the   medical   practitioner   has   a   heightened   level   of  responsibility  to  meet  community  needs.  Rural  and  Remote  Medicine  encompasses  the best models of care for these contexts. It is typically delivered through pri vate community - based practices and hospitals but  also  on  roadsides,  in  remote  clinics,  prisons,  Aboriginal  Medical  Services,  military  front lines or via telephone or digital health systems. Remote  medicine  applies  also  to  exchanges  between  hospital  servic es  that  need  to cross - check diagnostics before giving a treatment. There  are  already  a  number  of  examples  of  applications  serving  remote  medicine  and they often use leased line in order to have a good service quality because most  of the data exchanged are video and/or high quality pictures. Now, with 5G, it should be possible to get a similar quality of service but is has to be verified through such a  pilot.",healthcare,

The  5G  performances  as  large  bandwidth,  low  latency,  slicing and reliability are key enablers of these servi ces. Pilots could be done in different areas: - In  suburban  areas  where  children  living  in  small  villages  spread  on  a  vast  region  could  be  gathered  in  a  single  virtual  class.  Nowaday,  in  these  kind  of  villages,  schools  gather  in  one  class  children  with  diffe rent  ages  in  order  to  reach  the  minimal  number  to  form  a  single  class.  This  means  that  a  single  teacher  needs  to  address  different  level  of  education  in  the  same  class  reducing effectiveness and efficiency.  The remote education service may be  used  to  crea te  homogenous  classes  with  children  of  the  same  age  living  in  different places. In such a way it�s possible to create homogenous classes as  happens  in  large  cities  where  a  great  number  of  children  of  the  same  ages  live close to each other and go physically in the same school.  - The  same  requirement  applies  to  children  that  are  hospitalized  for  long  periods.

Study Group,"tudy Group, a global education company, focuses on language education, higher education, and career education in 43 schools and 78 office locations worldwide. The primary goal is to prepare students to be successful in a global economy. By partnering with universities and schools around the world, Study Group functions both on-site and also has separate facilities for students to fulfill their educational goals.  Craig Coleiro, Study Group�s Global Director of Technology Services and Infrastructure, first encountered Cisco Meraki at the end of 2011 and was immediately drawn to Meraki�s family of wireless products. After comparing several vendors, Meraki�s cloud management platform stood out from the crowd as the best solution to solve the problems of limited network visibility and manual on-site configurations, particularly when people resources were already limited.  Study Group�s IT team first began the journey with Meraki by requesting a free trial for MR Access Points, thereby becoming familiar with the full feature set of the dashboard. The team moved forward by placing an order for 598 APs and quickly began global deployment. Now, the days consist of remote oversight and management, making it easy for IT to make network changes and troubleshoot even when they are not on-site.  With Meraki APs in place, user access controlled by Active Directory (AD) was easily integrated. Corporate employees, faculty, and students connect securely and easily to the network, with individual group policies. Corporate employees connect to a central Study Group hub, leading to increased communication and sharing between sites. Faculty members can quickly pull up lessons plans, modify student records, and post lectures thanks to the high bandwidth speeds. Students, many of whom are international, can not only get their schoolwork done online and share notes with peers, but they can also communicate with friends and family across land and sea.  As Coleiro�s team began re-evaluating Study Group�s security and switching devices, Meraki was top of mind. They requested another free trial and today, all four data centers are equipped with Meraki gear, including 44 MX Security Appliances and 45 MS Switches. From just about every corner of the world, Coleiro can keep a pulse on the health of the network and upon seeing issues in real-time, assign personnel to troubleshoot.",education,

Century Care Management,"When Ed Sharp joined Century Care Management two years ago, one of the first things he wanted to address was wireless internet access. �We needed to join the 21st century,� he said. �We finally got serious about it this year.�  Century Care Management, a skilled nursing management company based in Cary, North Carolina, manages eight nursing homes across North Carolina. These facilities offer both short-term and long-term care and rehabilitation, with the smallest facility containing 80 beds and the largest featuring 140. Century Care employs over 400 clinical and 15 corporate staff members.  Century Care originally had one consumer-grade wireless access point (AP) at each facility and at headquarters, but these APs had limited range and could only be used by Century Care's internal staff. �It was very much a stopgap measure,� said Sharp, Director of Support Services.  Meanwhile, multiple constituents desired internet access. �The visiting doctors brought in laptops when seeing residents, and they wanted to use the laptop-based clinical software from their hospitals,� Sharp explained. �Our residents wanted to connect to the outside world using wireless. And our staff couldn't use their laptops everywhere in the building�they had to be near the access point.� Visiting pharmacists and state inspectors wanted access as well. �Everybody was feeling the pain. We knew we needed to take a long-term strategic look at how we provide wireless services in our company,� Sharp said.  The wired network infrastructure was already in place. Each of Century Care's eight nursing home facilities has a business-class ISP link for public and private traffic. The connection to headquarters runs through a site-to-site VPN network (a hub-and-spoke architecture). Legacy routing and switching infrastructure manages traffic at each location.  To smooth the transition to network-wide wireless, Century Care worked with value-added reseller Eproach to find a cost-effective, easy to manage solution. �We're a very lean and mean company,� Sharp said. �We don't have a lot of technology resources to provide support or care and feeding for any solution we put in, so whatever we did, we knew it had to be easy to take care of long term.�  In addition, Sharp knew he needed to be able to separate public versus private traffic in order to maintain the security of corporate and patient data. �HIPAA compliance was tantamount to any consideration we had,� he said.  After evaluating wireless solutions from Meru and Meraki, Sharp said it was Meraki�s cloud-based model with the dashboard that swayed him. �I was attracted to the idea that I don't need to host anything or have any servers here,� he said. �Instead, I can access everything from one simple, web-based dashboard, and that makes for a very clean, easy-to-manage solution.�  Century Care deployed 75 Meraki MR14 dual-radio 802.11n APs across its eight nursing home facilities and its headquarters. Eproach installed the APs using a phased approach, focusing on one location for a day or two each week. �It was pretty quick,' Sharp said. �The implementation was totally painless from our perspective.�  He still remembers when the first set of APs came online. �Eproach called when the first site was done and gave me the username and password,� he said. �I jumped into the dashboard and bang, I could see the site and the APs. The dashboard was so intuitive and easy to use, I started using the features and making changes to the environment right away.�",healthcare,

This is where Meraki steps in, acting as the backbone to the communications infrastructure to make sure that the biggest challenge of getting the right information to the right people is the last worry for the IT team. Previous to discovering Meraki cloud managed products, Bill Viggers, the IT Manager, along with his team, was using a mixture of networking equipment from different vendors. As soon as Bill joined Wellington Free Ambulance, he saw the need for a more secure network, one that could protect and help transfer sensitive information, while offering more robust features to easily manage the network.   The core network was running on old and unreliable equipment, making the team eager to begin exploring new vendors. As Bill familiarized himself with different options, Meraki quickly stood out amongst the crowd with the intuitive management tool as the key differentiator.
