          <p>
              The term 5G denotes the next major phase of mobile telecommunications standards beyond the current 4G. Currently under development, 5G is about to revolutionize the world, allowing to create a future believed to be out of our reach.</p>
          <p>The transition from wireless 4G networks to 5G networks may seem to be just another update as there are tens in the world of technology, but the 5G is a special case. Every generation of mobile network so far, including 4G, has been used to connect people, however the fifth generation will offer a wide connection between things and objects, such as people, cars, drones and IoT, creating a huge stream of data and changing our world forever.</p>

            <p>An obvious response would be a faster network (5G should be 10 times faster than it’s predecessor), but speed is not the most revolutionary aspect.
                5G is being built from A to Z to ensure a secure signal with low latency. This reliability is what makes the 5G a network for “things”, which would trigger a new wave of automation.</p>

                <p>In a world that is now largely digitized, the field of automation is enormous.
                    In the industry for example, we can imagine factories deploying machines and connected objects to make the manufacture
                     much more efficient.The idea of a “smart city” is also very dependent on automation.</p>
                     <p>If we want to avoid dystopian traffic jams, we need sensors to manage the flow of traffic, predict problems and dynamically adjust signaling to compensate. To save energy, we need sensors to turn on and off the light in response to the presence of a car.</p>
          
                     
          <p>When 5G becomes a global standard, it should bring a better connection between all these components to encourage a system to work in a holistic way. Unlike all connected devices that currently populate your home.</p>
              <p>   5G migration continues to command industry attention and discussion. Strategy Analytics said that by 2025, 5G is forecast to reach 690 million connections and more than 300 million handset shipments. Guang Yang, senior analyst for Strategy Analytics, said, “5G network plans have developed well in 2016, driving an ecosystem that will put 7% of mobile connections on 5G networks by 2025.”</p>
