case_study,"Probably the most popular smart agriculture gadgets are weather stations, combining various smart farming sensors. Located across the field, they collect various data from the environment and send it to the cloud. The provided measurements can be used to map the climate conditions, choose the appropriate crops, and take the required measures to improve their capacity (i.e. precision farming).",
case_study,"In addition to sourcing environmental data, weather stations can automatically adjust the conditions to match the given parameters. Specifically, greenhouse automation systems use a similar principle.  For instance, Farmapp and Growlink are also IoT agriculture products offering such capabilities among others.  GreenIQ is also an interesting product that uses smart agriculture sensors. It is a smart sprinklers controller that allows you to manage your irrigation and lighting systems remotely",
case_study,"One more type of IoT product in agriculture and another element of precision farming are crop management devices. Just like weather stations, they should be placed in the field to collect data specific to crop farming; from temperature and precipitation to leaf water potential and overall crop health.  Thus, you can monitor your crop growth and any anomalies to effectively prevent any diseases or infestations that can harm your yield. Arable and Semios can serve as good representations of how this use case can be applied in real life.",
case_study,"Just like crop monitoring, there are IoT agriculture sensors that can be attached to the animals on a farm to monitor their health and log performance. This works similarly to IoT devices for petcare.  For example, SCR by Allflex and Cowlar use smart agriculture sensors (collar tags) to deliver temperature, health, activity, and nutrition insights on each individual cow as well as collective information about the herd",

In doing so, farmers were able to optimize their irrigation process in order to use less water while increasing plant yields due to optimized conditions.",
case_study,"Crop diseases are one of many hurdles farmers and those working in agriculture have to continually deal with. One way in which farmers in the Indian State of Punjab are fighting these diseases is through the data collected by IoT-enabled remote sensors. By monitoring conditions such as humidity, rainfall and temperature levels, farmers are able to better determine their crops susceptibility to disease and act accordingly. With India�s population now surpassing a whopping 1.2 billion people, the ability of farmers across the country to grow crops with a reduced risk of failure due to disease is essential. Smart Farming IoT solutions promise to provide greater food-security and optimized yield for this largely agrarian economy.",
case_study,"Another battle farmers are constantly fighting is that with pests. Greenflies and fruit flies are among those targeted by farmers in order to protect their crops. In Slovenia, several fruit growers have begun to use data and automation to fight back against these pests. By using the data collected from remote sensors and other equipment, growers can begin to understand their fruit or crop�s growing habits better which can then help manage pests more effectively. Using similar methods, data from such sensors has also been used to automate and enhance the efficacy of spraying pesticides which can also save time, money and resources.  So, we�ve now seen how the adoption of Internet of Things applications in agriculture is making a real difference, not only by speeding things up or automating them, but by also providing the data that enables those working in farming and agriculture to visualize their performance and actively take steps to improve their operations and end product. However, don�t go thinking that the integration of IoT applications in agriculture don�t come with challenges of their own. In order to best realize the potential for these applications, farmers and those working agriculture will need to encourage new practices and procedures in order to secure and maintain these network systems.",

This is where Meraki steps in, acting as the backbone to the communications infrastructure to make sure that the biggest challenge of getting the right information to the right people is the last worry for the IT team. Previous to discovering Meraki cloud managed products, Bill Viggers, the IT Manager, along with his team, was using a mixture of networking equipment from different vendors. As soon as Bill joined Wellington Free Ambulance, he saw the need for a more secure network, one that could protect and help transfer sensitive information, while offering more robust features to easily manage the network.   The core network was running on old and unreliable equipment, making the team eager to begin exploring new vendors. As Bill familiarized himself with different options, Meraki quickly stood out amongst the crowd with the intuitive management tool as the key differentiator.
