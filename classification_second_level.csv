education,"Having   a  network   capable   of  transferring   our   tactile  communication  through  Internet  will  help  us  to  move  from  today �s content  and information  delivery  Internet  to  a  manual  skill set delivery  Internet .  This  will  create  new  ways  of  Tele - teaching and  T ele - mentoring especially for manual  training and skill development . The use of Tactile Internet in education  can bring new definition and experience for distance learning and distance team - working.  In order to have  a natural haptic interaction of ou r limbs with video and audio feedback the response time of service should  be very low, i.e., the round trip  time o f few m illiseconds which can be only envisaged by 5G.",,,
education,"Whi le the initial use  case  for VR was  the  entertainment industry,  it also has relevance in education and training, and will have a big role in providing quality education and improving  understanding - based learning among students.  By t ailoring these services  to education ,  ( e.g . by , having  virtual t our s of the human body with the possibility of interacting with model s and moving  the  different  layers of  the  body ) ,  the  learning process can be  more fun and  much more interesting. This also  can bring  new experience s for distance learning ,  enabling the vir tual  presence of students (e.g.,  located  in suburban  area ) in the classroom . This type of service need s very high bandwidth (bi - directional) and very low latency (i.e., 2 � 4ms).",,,
education,"Similar to  the  VR,  AR  has  already  started  to  show  its  relevance  and  usefulness in education. Providing  the  necessary information can make contextualised learning ubiquitous  and pervasive.  AR can be an efficient way of providing  the  right amount of information at  the right time to  the right  audience .  Also, immersive AR can enable new way s of learning and team working in education  through services such as mobile cloud classroom and Virtual Presence .  Enhancing  the  learning experien ce  is not the only possible use  case for AR. It can also help teachers to get necessary information about each  student and be aware of their  particular need s and capabilities. The requirements for implementing such  services ,  including optimised routing, seamless wide - area coverage, virtual p resence, low delay speech &  video coding,  need to be considered .",,,
education,"By  combining  Tactile  Internet  and  VR ,  the  future  experience  in  teaching  and  learning could  go  far  beyond  today �s exp erience . This  can  remove  the  physical  location  constraint  for  experimental  practices , and  facilitate and  enable the  shar ing of  resources between  larger numbers of  students irrespective  of  their  current  location .  The  impact  would  be  more  significant  in  hands - on - experience with expensive equipment and fa cilities.",,,
education,"Individual access to a mobile device holds the promise to connect each learner into  intelligent  personalised  systems  that  can  suggest  learning  pathways,  enable  aggregated  analysis  and  through better data capture of learner  experiences enable much better decision making about all aspects  of a students� education.  Categorising students in different groups and suggesting different multi - media  contents can increase the load on the network. However, i n - network caching technologie s such as  Content  Centric  Networks  (CCN)  and  Inform ation  Centric  Networks  (ICN)  can  be  used  to  improve  efficiency  by  reducing the service response time and bandwidth consumption.

education,Today�s cloud - based  storage  services have  made  it possible  to access  files irrespective of device of use .  D ue to the centralised architecture of  cloud providers there is  a  notable delay  in access  to  the  content  even  with  a  relatively  fast  internet  connection.  Future  mobile  technology  will  4 enable single d evice content access anywhere by using distributed cloud and mobile edge computing. All  the  user needs is a device to access any of his personal content and stored file s .  Using this feature students  can  resume  their  work  at  a convenient  time  and  place  thro ugh  different  device s with  an  impression  of  immediate response time . ,,,
education,"Advances in mobile technology and robotics can open new opportunities  to assist students  with  especial  needs ,  making learning easier  for  them .  Cloud - based  ro bots  can  be  considered as  a  full - time  assistan t for  disabled  students,  helping  them  to  interact  with  the  education  environment and  their  peers . Rather than having  to call a teacher over for help ( which can cost both the  student  and  the  teacher  time  they  c o uld  be  using  more  productively )  the  student s can  take  care  of  the  issue with the help of their robot.

education,"IoT applications are affecting all aspect of our life, from smart  building to smart healthcare. However, one of the fast growing area of these applications is in education  which can improve our today�s teaching, learning and campus operating experience. IoT applications c an  also help us change the role of teachers in the classroom, reducing the burden of administrative load on  them  and  allowing  them  to  concentrate  more  on  individuals.  B eing  automatically  logged  into  the  classroom  as  soon  as  entering  to  the  class ,  being  dis tracted  by  a  signal  as  soon  as  losing  concentration  during lecture, real - time feedback to a lecturer about areas that students still have problem based on  the  real - time  analyses  of their  notes,  all  are  just  few  examples  of  how  IoT  and  connected  classroom  c an  enhance learning and teaching experience.",,,

healthcare,"It is now commonplace for most people to own mobile connected leisure wearables such as fitness trackers that actively capture, process and report real-time data that can then be accessed and assessed by the user. However, with the introduction of 5G, similar trackers will be able to make advantage of much faster connection speeds and ultimately transform the standard doctor/patient relationship around the world.  Clinical tracking devices and low-energy, low bit-rate sensors will allow doctors to remotely monitor and analyse patient�s vitals, activity and even potentially tell them whether the user has taken medication without the need to travel to a surgery or hospital location, freeing up vital time and resources to be used elsewhere. These devices are known as IoMT (Internet of Medical Things).  The data captured by IoMT devices will support fully-predicative analytics, greatly reducing the time it will take to detect a health issue and significantly increasing the accuracy of doctor�s diagnoses.",,,
healthcare,"With 5G services, trips to your local doctor�s surgery could become a thing of the past. With the greatly improved data rates that 5G will bring, 3D ultra-HD live video streaming will allow you to connect with your GP in real-time and even access VR (virtual-reality) services simultaneously to help doctors to explain care and patients understand treatment.  These services are invaluable for those patients who are less able to access physical locations because of health issues or the rural location of their home.  Aside from patient care, the same remote streaming consultations could be used for professional training to other healthcare professionals around the world who would otherwise be confined to text-books or basic online learning resources. Using VR, medical students would be able to virtually follow a real-life example of patient care.",,,
healthcare,"It may sound like something out of a science-fiction movie, but automated, assisted and fully-robotic services has already begun in surgeries around the world and will significantly improve with the introduction of 5G. This includes the use of haptic devices such as gloves, that allow a surgeon to wear a glove-like device to remotely move and �feel� the patient they are operating on from a different location.  The use of such robotic devices could be used for extremely long surgeries where a human surgeon could become fatigued or lose concentration over a long period of time. Also, they could be used as an assistant to a human surgeon, guiding and assessing the patient as the surgeon operates.",,,
healthcare,"Potentially one of the oldest and most important techniques for diagnoses comes from scanning a patient�s body for clues and information in to their condition. With 5G, scanning could be achieved at a fraction of the time it currently takes and made available for review more quickly and to more healthcare professionals in near real-time. The services could also feed in to the video and VR capabilities that 5G would bring, allowing for multiple patient assessment and ultimately more accurate diagnosis.",,,
agriculture,"  5G will provide real-time data in amazing ways and when used alongside agricultural practices, these new abilities to monitor, track and automate systems in lightning fast speed with will give rise to smart-farming.

It is also responsible  for the day-to-day management of traffic signals on the city�s major highways. Having replaced the previous Greater Manchester Passenger Transport  Executive, the role of TfGM in the community has grown significantly. For  example, it assumed responsibility for developing an Urban Traffic Control  scheme designed to help ensure that the city�s traffic flows freely. In addition, it  has an increasingly important responsibility for passenger safety and security.   However, TfGM faced several challenges. The organization needed to standardize  and centralize its IT architecture, because each site had a separate infrastructure.  For example, 20 bus stations might have 20 different CCTV systems. Also,  although a single maintenance contract with one supplier was already in place,  that company had to support many different systems. �Previously we had an MPLS network that just supported corporate processes,�  says Rohan Mendis, ICT consultant for TfGM, �but to introduce services like  IP CCTV, we needed to upgrade to a new multiservice network with greater  capability.� So, before it could start on the all-important task of optimizing  transport operations, TfGM first needed a common IP platform over which it  could standardize IT services and operational processes.",,,

agriculture,"Probably the most popular smart agriculture gadgets are weather stations, combining various smart farming sensors. Located across the field, they collect various data from the environment and send it to the cloud. The provided measurements can be used to map the climate conditions, choose the appropriate crops, and take the required measures to improve their capacity (i.e. precision farming).",,,
agriculture,"In addition to sourcing environmental data, weather stations can automatically adjust the conditions to match the given parameters. Specifically, greenhouse automation systems use a similar principle.  For instance, Farmapp and Growlink are also IoT agriculture products offering such capabilities among others.  GreenIQ is also an interesting product that uses smart agriculture sensors. It is a smart sprinklers controller that allows you to manage your irrigation and lighting systems remotely",,,
agriculture,"One more type of IoT product in agriculture and another element of precision farming are crop management devices. Just like weather stations, they should be placed in the field to collect data specific to crop farming; from temperature and precipitation to leaf water potential and overall crop health.  Thus, you can monitor your crop growth and any anomalies to effectively prevent any diseases or infestations that can harm your yield. Arable and Semios can serve as good representations of how this use case can be applied in real life.",,,
agriculture,"Just like crop monitoring, there are IoT agriculture sensors that can be attached to the animals on a farm to monitor their health and log performance. This works similarly to IoT devices for petcare.  For example, SCR by Allflex and Cowlar use smart agriculture sensors (collar tags) to deliver temperature, health, activity, and nutrition insights on each individual cow as well as collective information about the herd",,,
agriculture,"A more complex approach to IoT products in agriculture can be represented by the so-called farm productivity management systems. They usually include a number of agriculture IoT devices and sensors, installed on the premises as well as a powerful dashboard with analytical capabilities and in-built accounting/reporting features.  This offers remote farm monitoring capabilities and allows you to streamline most of the business operations. Similar solutions are represented by FarmLogs and Cropio.  In addition to the listed IoT agriculture use cases, some prominent opportunities include vehicle tracking (or even automation), storage management, logistics, etc.",,,
agriculture,"With fruit being one of Chile�s largest exports, farmers in country need to be able to produce large amounts in order to satisfy demand. According to researchers at Chile�s UCSC University, the implementation of remote sensors around farming areas has reduced the volume of water used by 70%. The placement of sensors in the soil allowed farmers and researchers to monitor the conditions of the soil as well as the plant�s requirements. In doing so, farmers were able to optimize their irrigation process in order to use less water while increasing plant yields due to optimized conditions.",,,
agriculture,"Crop diseases are one of many hurdles farmers and those working in agriculture have to continually deal with. One way in which farmers in the Indian State of Punjab are fighting these diseases is through the data collected by IoT-enabled remote sensors. By monitoring conditions such as humidity, rainfall and temperature levels, farmers are able to better determine their crops susceptibility to disease and act accordingly. With India�s population now surpassing a whopping 1.2 billion people, the ability of farmers across the country to grow crops with a reduced risk of failure due to disease is essential. Smart Farming IoT solutions promise to provide greater food-security and optimized yield for this largely agrarian economy.",,,
agriculture,"Another battle farmers are constantly fighting is that with pests. Greenflies and fruit flies are among those targeted by farmers in order to protect their crops. In Slovenia, several fruit growers have begun to use data and automation to fight back against these pests. By using the data collected from remote sensors and other equipment, growers can begin to understand their fruit or crop�s growing habits better which can then help manage pests more effectively. Using similar methods, data from such sensors has also been used to automate and enhance the efficacy of spraying pesticides which can also save time, money and resources.  So, we�ve now seen how the adoption of Internet of Things applications in agriculture is making a real difference, not only by speeding things up or automating them, but by also providing the data that enables those working in farming and agriculture to visualize their performance and actively take steps to improve their operations and end product. However, don�t go thinking that the integration of IoT applications in agriculture don�t come with challenges of their own. In order to best realize the potential for these applications, farmers and those working agriculture will need to encourage new practices and procedures in order to secure and maintain these network systems.",,,

healthcare,"Covering an area with 300,000 to 400,000 inhabitants, Wellington Free Ambulance provides free, world-class paramedic care to the people of the greater Wellington and Wairarapa regions of New Zealand. With only 150 full-time paramedics providing frontline ambulance services, no patient information can be miscommunicated or risk not being delivered. This is where Meraki steps in, acting as the backbone to the communications infrastructure to make sure that the biggest challenge of getting the right information to the right people is the last worry for the IT team. Previous to discovering Meraki cloud managed products, Bill Viggers, the IT Manager, along with his team, was using a mixture of networking equipment from different vendors. As soon as Bill joined Wellington Free Ambulance, he saw the need for a more secure network, one that could protect and help transfer sensitive information, while offering more robust features to easily manage the network.   The core network was running on old and unreliable equipment, making the team eager to begin exploring new vendors. As Bill familiarized himself with different options, Meraki quickly stood out amongst the crowd with the intuitive management tool as the key differentiator. The team attended a Meraki webinar and received a MR Access Point (AP).

If a connection is too slow or the delay is uneven it means that other gamers are one step ahead and a step in a shooter video game is the difference between life and death Today we played Overwatch over a 5G connection and I did not notice any difference between it and a fixed line connection. Its latency did not skip and it felt like a fixed connection,,,
entertainment,it is becoming more popular to stream gaming sessions to online channels focused on eSports. During the 5G test bit flow was sent alongside gaming to Twitch Tv. A solid flow of bits run smoothly to the service,,,
entertainment,Nvidia demonstrated GeForce Now�s capability with 5G during AT&T�s Spark Conference in San Francisco. According to The Register a fairly run-of-the-mill laptop was hooked up to a 5G base station and was able to achieve 60 frames-per-second framerate with only 16ms of lag. This could feasibly be reduced down to as little as 3ms in the future which Nvidia said could allow users to play virtual reality games without needing expensive extra hardware,,,
